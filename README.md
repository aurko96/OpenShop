# OpenShop


Summary:
1. It is a website for transaction of buying or selling products online
2. It gives an online platform for electronic business deals
3. It allows consumers to electronically exchange goods and services with no time or distance barriers
4. It creates an easy communication and negotiation room for transaction among the buyer and seller


Features:
1. A buyer or a seller have its own particular account in the website
2. The seller can upload their product along with their desired price and picture of the product and with other editable features and details
3. A buyer can go through various categories and subcategories of products for sell and can communicate with the seller for the desired product
4. The product will be shown from the database as the customer desires, for example sorted by category, sorted by price, and sorted by new or used product.
5. The buyer will have a ‘add to favorites’ or wish list section to keep tag of the interested product they wish to buy
6. The buyer can order a product via shipment process or they can have the sellers contact number to negotiate among themselves about product transaction
7. There are particular number of shippers assigned to a particular district for product shipment. Each shipper takes four orders a day and can take pre-order for the upcoming week. Our system tries to provide the buyer with the earliest delivery date possible depending on the workload of the shippers at that particular district.
